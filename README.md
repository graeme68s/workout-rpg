Cool little gamified workout app
"Workout RPG: A privacy-first, zero-latency gym tracker designed for the gym floor. No accounts, no tracking, just gains. Save it to your home screen and level up your training. Get points for turning up, for consistency, level up to be the final boss"

Instructions: Save as html and save to your home screen on IOS. You can save the data. If you clear your browser cache your data will be gone though, since it uses local storage. I will level the whole app up, if i get interest. I am making this public to help people get healthier by being motivated to go to the gym. If you like it please share it.
